# Mortgage Page Dialog Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the mortgage page to use a dialog-based interface for editing mortgage parameters, with a combo box to select from available mortgage profiles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dialog Component (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
- Added Radix UI dialog component with proper styling
- Includes Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogFooter, DialogTitle, DialogDescription
- Responsive design with proper animations and accessibility

### 2. Updated Mortgage Page (`src/app/mortgage/page.tsx`)

#### New State Management:
- `showEditDialog`: Controls dialog visibility
- `selectedMortgageId`: Tracks selected mortgage from combo box
- `tempInputs`: Temporary state for form changes before applying

#### New Functions:
- `handleOpenEditDialog()`: Opens dialog with current inputs
- `handleCloseEditDialog()`: Closes dialog and resets state
- `handleApplyChanges()`: Applies temporary changes to main inputs
- `handleTempInputChange()`: Updates temporary form state
- `handleSelectMortgage()`: Loads selected mortgage profile into form

#### UI Changes:
- **Removed**: Expandable form section
- **Added**: "Edit Parameters" button that opens dialog
- **Added**: Dialog with all mortgage form fields
- **Added**: Combo box to select from saved mortgage profiles
- **Added**: Cancel and Apply Changes buttons in dialog footer

### 3. Package Installation
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-dialog` for dialog functionality

## New User Experience

### Before:
- Form was expandable/collapsible within the main page
- Update button was in the header
- No way to select from saved mortgages

### After:
- Clean, compact main page showing current mortgage summary
- "Edit Parameters" button opens a modal dialog
- Dialog contains:
  - **Combo box** to select from saved mortgage profiles (if any exist)
  - **All form fields** for editing mortgage parameters
  - **Cancel** and **Apply Changes** buttons in the footer
- Changes are only applied when "Apply Changes" is clicked
- Cancel discards any changes made in the dialog

## Key Features

1. **Mortgage Selection**: Users can select from their saved mortgage profiles via combo box
2. **Temporary Editing**: Changes are made in temporary state until applied
3. **Cancel/Apply Pattern**: Clear separation between editing and applying changes
4. **Responsive Design**: Dialog is responsive and scrollable for smaller screens
5. **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing UI design patterns

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Modal dialog provides focused editing experience
2. **Space Efficient**: Main page is cleaner without expandable form
3. **Profile Integration**: Easy selection from saved mortgage profiles
4. **Clear Actions**: Explicit Cancel/Apply buttons prevent accidental changes
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Dialog works well on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Radix UI for accessibility and keyboard navigation

- Combo box integration with existing mortgage profiles
- Proper form validation and error handling
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
