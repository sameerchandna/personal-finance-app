# Mortgage Database Integration - Testing Guide

## Overview
We have successfully implemented database persistence for the mortgage section with the following components:

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Updated `mortgage_calculations` table**: Added all required fields from the mortgage form including payment_type, rate_type, extra_payment, start_date, fixed_rate_end_date, variable_rate, and variable_rate_enabled
- **New `mortgage_profiles` table**: Created for storing multiple mortgage properties per user in the financial profile section

### 2. Database Service Updates
- **Updated `financialProfileService`**: Added CRUD operations for mortgage profiles (getMortgageProfiles, saveMortgageProfile, updateMortgageProfile, deleteMortgageProfile)
- **Updated Supabase types**: Added mortgage_profiles table types to the Database interface

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Financial Profile Page**: Updated to load, save, edit, and delete mortgage profiles from the database
- **Mortgage Calculator Page**: Already compatible with the updated schema (uses existing useSavedCalculations hook)

## Database Schema Files
- `database-schema-mortgage-complete.sql`: Complete mortgage schema with both tables
- `database-schema-financial-profile.sql`: Existing financial profile schema
- `database-schema.sql`: Original schema (needs to be updated)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Database Setup
1. Run the SQL from `database-schema-mortgage-complete.sql` in your Supabase database
2. Ensure the `update_updated_at_column()` function exists (from original schema)

### 2. Test Financial Profile Mortgage Section
1. Navigate to `/financial-profile`
2. Expand the "Mortgage Details" section
3. Add a new mortgage with all fields filled
4. Verify it saves to the database
5. Edit the mortgage and verify updates work
6. Delete the mortgage and verify deletion works
7. Refresh the page and verify data persists

### 3. Test Mortgage Calculator
1. Navigate to `/mortgage`
2. Fill out the mortgage calculator form
3. Click "Save/Load" and save a calculation
4. Verify it appears in the saved calculations list
5. Load a saved calculation and verify data populates correctly
6. Delete a saved calculation and verify it's removed

### 4. Test Data Persistence
1. Add mortgages in both sections
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. Verify all mortgage data persists across sessions
