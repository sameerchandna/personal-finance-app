Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of your current application. Based on what I can see, you have a solid foundation with mortgage and investment calculators. Let me brainstorm all the information you'll need from users to build a comprehensive personal finance projection system for retirement planning.

## **Suggested Implementation Approach**

Given your current architecture, I'd recommend building this as additional components:

1. **Personal Profile Setup** - Initial onboarding to collect basic info
2. **Asset & Liability Tracker** - Comprehensive balance sheet
3. **Cash Flow Analyzer** - Income vs expenses tracking
4. **Retirement Projector** - The main engine that combines everything
5. **Scenario Planner** - "What if" analysis tools
6. **Tax Optimizer** - Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies

## **Database Schema Extensions**

You'll need to extend your current schema to include:
- `user_profiles` (personal info, goals, assumptions)
- `assets` (all asset types with current values)
- `liabilities` (all debt types)
- `expenses` (categorized monthly/annual expenses)
- `income_sources` (salary, rental, etc.)
- `retirement_scenarios` (saved projections)

Would you like me to help you design the database schema for these additional components, or would you prefer to start with a specific component like the personal profile setup or asset tracker?
